<p>A State of the Union Address is mandated by Article II, Section 3 of the
U.S. Constitution. It is through State of the Union where the President
and the Executive Branch is able to lay out their policy focus and try
to recommend, or really push, Congress to go in certain policy
directions.</p>

<p>Over time these addresses have substantially changed. The first several
State of the Unions by George Washington and John Adams were speeches to
Congress. Thomas Jefferson, however, began a 100 year tradition of
giving written addresses. Jefferson felt that the practice needed to be
changed to written because the oral presentation was too similar to the
British Monarch practice of addressing new parliament with policy
mandates rather than policy recommendations. In 1913 Woodrow Wilson
changed it back to an oral presentation to Congress, which has remained
the norm ever since.</p>

<p>There are obvious major differences in tone, content, and standard of
language when something is written versus something that is spoken.
These differences are shown in the data, with written speeches being on
average XXX words and spoken speeches being on average of XXX words. The
longest speech was XXX in XXX at XXX words and the shortest speech was
XXXX words by XXX in XXXX.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-data">Getting the Data</h2>

<p>All of the the data was scraped from XXX website, where I was able to
develop a dataset with each SOTU speech and all the necessary metadata,
such as president name, year of the address, and the political party of
the president.</p>

<p><img src="\img\posts\SOTU\SOTUwebpage.png" alt="sotu webpage" /></p>

<p>I then was able to analyze the data from several different viewpoints.
This analysis mostly covers 1-gram and bigram tokens, meaning that each
row in the data was either a single word or a pair of words. Such a
format allows us to analyze word frequencies, and word usage over time,
among other things</p>

<h2 id="some-mildly-interesting-facts-about-sotu-addresses">Some Mildly Interesting Facts about SOTU Addresses</h2>

<p>What are the most common words, on average per speech (ordered boxplot)
broken out by speech and written (frequencies will be very different
based on massive difference in length of addresses)</p>

<p>tf-idf by president - lets show last 6 presidents, but lets see if we
can build interactive tool, that would be super cool to show the top 15
words by tf-idf for whatever chosen president</p>

<h2 id="so-how-has-the-state-of-black-americans-been-discussed-in-sotus">So how has the State of Black Americans been discussed in SOTUs?</h2>

<p>Activism leads to being talked about -&gt; leads to getting attention of
leaders -&gt; leads to being discussed by leaders -&gt; leads to policy
decisions and attention to targeted policy -&gt; end note = activism
matters, awareness matters, silence matters silence = less policy focus</p>

<p>Point out how black people have been discussed. when discussed, is it
actually for the benefit of them? Pull out the excerpt from abraham
lincoln - even in a time when black people are fighting for freedom,
lincoln spends XX lines on bargaining and pursuading white people that
they will be okay when black people are free.</p>

<p>most discussions about black people has not been around the livelihood
of black folk. Itâ€™s been around the white elites and making sure they
are happy or talking directly to them.</p>
