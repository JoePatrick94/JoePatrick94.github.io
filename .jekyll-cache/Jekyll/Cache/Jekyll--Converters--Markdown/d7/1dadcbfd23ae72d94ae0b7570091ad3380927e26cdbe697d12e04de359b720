I"C<p>Hey all, welcome to my page. I am a data scientist in the Washington D.C. metro area where I work for Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting company that primarily deals with federal clients. I love exploring topics through data science methods and telling stories of what I’ve found. I mostly enjoy topics that don’t excite too many people, but I will try my best to deliver exciting content on these not so exciting topics. I graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Psychology and have a master’s degree in Biostatistics from George Mason University.</p>
